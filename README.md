# EE298 (Deep Learning): Assignment no.1 - CIFAR-10-Classification

This repository contains CIFAR-10 classifier using 3-Layer MLP and 3-Layer CNN models.
The MLP achieved a 54.44% accuracy while the CNN achieved a 76.17% accuracy. 
The classifier was implemented using Keras with a Tensorflow backend.

By comparison, CNN model performs better than MLP model in terms of Testing accuracy. 
CNN is better in extracting feature maps for classification than MLP.
